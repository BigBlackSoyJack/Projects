So hello fine people of the Interwebs! If you're reading this, you've probably seen my content over on YouTube. If that's the case, thank you for taking interest in my other hobbies :).
If you took the time to read my bio, you'd know that I'm active on multiple platforms such as Instagram, YouTube and etc. all under the name of BigBlackSoyJack.
My coding commissions are almost always open, just DM me and I'll let you know if I have the ability to make your project come to life!
